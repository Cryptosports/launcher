Even with the guidance that Anders provided I could not get this to work. My problem was with the image itself.

These steps worked for me using GIMP 2.8.10:

-   create an image using RGB mode (Image > Mode > RGB) using the appropriate size for whatever you are creating (164x314 for MUI_WELCOMEFINISHPAGE_BITMAP, 150x57 for MUI_HEADERIMAGE_BITMAP)

-   File > Export as ...

-   name your file with a .bmp extension

-   click "Export"

-   in the window titled "Export Image as BMP" expand "Compatibility Options" and check the box that says "Do not write color space information"

-   also, in the window titled "Export Image as BMP" expand "Advanced Options" and check the radio button under "24 bits" next to "R8 G8 B8"

-   click "Export"
